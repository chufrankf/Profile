This is my Profile. It is about some key points from my history of computer programming. Created in HTML/CSS. Ran as a Node.js express server on digitalocean. Installation was completed by following the amazingly well documented steps on the digitalocean community. Also an incredible tutorial is provided by [Jason Lengstorf](https://code.lengstorf.com/deploy-nodejs-ssl-digitalocean/)
